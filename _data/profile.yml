short_bio: >-
  I'm a tutor and researcher at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology. My research focus lies in the security of wireless communication systems particularly application and transport layer security, QUIC & IoT security, as well as security in 5G and beyond 5G networks. Iâ€™m also interested in the application of ML, AI, and blockchain to enhance security in these domains. As a learner and teacher at heart, I believe the meaning of life is to find your gift and the purpose of life is to give it away.
