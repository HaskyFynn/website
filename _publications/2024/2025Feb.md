  The development of intelligent wheelchairs has enhanced the quality of life of people with physical challenges through mobility and autonomy. These improvements can be beneficial to a large number of people. However, based on the the current wheelchair technologies, there are still some problems in terms of affordability, adaptability and most importantly, the user's needs and preferences. This is especially so for the disadvantaged populations in regions with constrained resources. In this review, the new developments in intelligent wheelchair systems about the robotic, sensing, and control systems are presented.
